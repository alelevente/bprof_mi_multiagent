# **Multi-agent laboratory**

This laboratory was created at the [Department of Measurement and Information Systems, Budapest University of Technology and Economics](mit.bme.hu) for the [Applied Artificial Intelligence](mit.bme.hu/https://www.mit.bme.hu/oktatas/targyak/vimibb01) course.

## **Goal of the laboratory**

Our goal is to give students a brief introduction to the topic of *cooperative artificial multi-agent systems*. To this end, a simple *constraint solving problem* is given: vehicles have to find parking lots for themselves. However, the individualistic approach can solve the problem, an *auction-based* solution can perform the assignment task more efficiently.

## **Prerequisites**
**Understading (the concept of):**
 - agents in artifical intelligence
 - constraint solving problems
 - auction mechanisms
 - usage of Python Notebooks

**Technical requirements:** (we provide them as a virtual machine in the computer laboratory of the university)
 - [Eclipse SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) installed
 - [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) installed
 
## **Learning outcomes**
By the end of the laboratory, the students are expected to:
 - understand the benefits of cooperation of intelligent systems
 - have experiments with auction mechanisms
 - (introduced to the basic concepts of traffic simulation tools)

## **Outline of the laboratory**
1. Run, and evaluate a simple simulation (uncoordinated parking scenario)
2. Design the auction mechanism for parking lot assignment
3. Run, and evaluate the auction coordinated simulation (cooperative parking scenario)
 
## **Material development phases**
[x] Setting up a simulation scenario

[] Providing the auction backend

[] Elaborating the laboratory tasks

[] Conducting measurements

[] Asking for feedbacks

[] Refine materials acc. to feedbacks
